I specialize in building beautiful, functional mobile apps using Flutter, Firebase, Bloc, and GetX. From fitness trackers to event management systems, I enjoy turning ideas into seamless user experiences.
    
    Over the past couple of years, I've built several Flutter applications, including major projects like a Fitness app for trainers and a complete Event Management system with modules for both clients and administrators. I'm proficient in Flutter, Dart, Firebase, RESTful APIs, Hive, GetX, Bloc, and MVVM architecture. I value clean UI, user experience, and performance in all my apps.
