const aboutMe =
    '''Hi, I'm Jasir, a passionate and self-taught Flutter developer from Malappuram, Kerala. I hold a Bachelor's degree in English from Annamalai University and completed a diploma in DEOA, which sparked my interest in technology and led me to specialize in mobile app development.

Currently, I am working at Tathkarah Travel & Tourism Private Limited, where I have gained over 1 year of hands-on experience. During this time, I have practiced and strengthened my skills by implementing real-time projects, which has emphasized my sense of responsibility, adaptability, and commitment to delivering high-quality work within a team environment.

Over the past couple of years, Iâ€™ve built several Flutter applications, including a Fitness app for trainers and a comprehensive Event Management system with modules for both clients and administrators. I am proficient in Flutter, Dart, Firebase, RESTful APIs, Hive, GetX, Bloc, and MVVM architecture. I focus on clean UI, smooth performance, and a user-centered experience.
